How much does a cardboard box cost?
## It turns out, a lot

So, normally a prime real estate cardboard box that is 100 x 100 x 80 cm in size would be around ~ $35.00 and we could just end this here. BUT there's always more. If you buy cardboard boxes in bulk, the boxes become cheaper, around $25.00 per box.<br><br>
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL, because if you manually gather materials it becomes only $10. But even more cheap is if you order enough amazon products you can get a 100 x 100 x 80 cardboard for FREE and that's about as cheap as it goes, since it only gets more pricey from here. If we take into account machine and human cost labour at minimum wage of $25 per hour in Australia, assuming it takes 2 minutes to assemble, brings the cheapest possible price of a box that doesn’t require other purchases to $10 (Material Cost) + 80c ($25/30 Labour Cost), So our cardboard box is around $10.80.

Now, if we treat the box as land and real estate, with the current area of it being 1x1 m^2 and a vertical column infinitely extending, in Sydney, it comes to an average cost of 1.8 million per 1000m2 of land and so our box’s land that if you own, costs $2460.00 (Land Cost) + $10.80 (Material & Building Cost)
And now, a 100 x 100 x 80 Cardboard Box Of Prime Real Estate comes to $2470.80 in total.
But the value increases further, since the land you occupy goes downwards forever and therefore owning the cardboard box property also enlists owning everything below it. The earth’s crust right below our 1 metre prime real estate on average contains about 17.5 grams of gold and silver, totalling $1500.00 and about 5000kg of aluminium and 3000kg of iron, coming to around ~ $15,000. Finally there is around $2000 worth of copper and rare earths. With the crust covered, our cardboard box soared to the price of $2460.00 (Land Cost) + $10.80 (Material & Building Cost) + $1500.00 (Gold & Silver) + $15000.00 (Aluminium + Iron) + $2000.00 (Copper + Rare Earth Minerals) = $20970.80

Accounting for the mantle however, our value climbs higher, and while magnesium is quite cheap around $3/kg, with the amount in our 1 metre of land, around 600 thousand kilos, it gets to around $1.8 million worth of magnesium. There are likely to be NO diamonds in our piece of prime real estate unfortunately. Finally, we get to the CORE of the earth, where most of our value resides in Iron, Nickel, Gold and Platinum that has sunk to this level after Earth’s creation and totals to a whopping 1.2 billion dollars ish on our piece of real estate.<br><br>
Finally After Those Short Calculations: A Standard Cardboard Box, Size 100 x 100 x 80 cm^2 Of Prime Real Estate On Land That You Own Costs Approximately:
$2,460.00 (Land Cost) + $10.80 (Material Building Cost) + $1,500.00 (Gold & Silver) + $15,000.00 (Aluminium & Iron) + $2,000.00 (Copper & Rare Earth Minerals + $1,800,000.00 (Magnesium In Mantle) + $1,200,000,000.00 (Iron, Nickel, Gold & Platinum In the Core)
= $1,201,820,970.80
